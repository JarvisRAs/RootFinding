DEMO.ipynb - 
cell 1 (#Local imports) has ModuleNotFound errors

cell 2 (# Use this cell to test the root finder.) spits out 
"842 ZEROS ARE CORRECT OUT OF 900
26 of them were about of range"
Should this be 'out of range'?

TVB.py:

TelenVanBarel:
    initial_poly_list - how are the polynomials passed in? As coefficients in ascending order, right? State that.
    run_checks - I don't understand what happens if this isn't true
    
    basisDict - first, you just switched naming conventions. second, is this a dict or a 'matrixes'? and which term can be reduced to what? this is also unclear
    VB - just a comment, shouldn't the terms be monomials anyway? Then why don't we return it as a row vector,s ince that's numpys default?
 also, giving an example of stuff being passed in and what you get out would be great
 
makeBasisDict:
    power - make this clear that you're talking about power vs chebyshev basis
    remainder_shape - why is a shape a list instead of a tuple (convention uses tuples for shape) also, how do we know what this shape is?
    
    basisDict - I'm confused as to what this is
    
find_degree:
    I like this one, it seems clear what it does and /i like the example, but why the constants in the formula? Is that a thm that we've proved?
    Also, naming conventions...

add_polys:
    to clarify, say that this adds all moniomial multiples up to specfied degree of hte TVB matrix
    
sorted_matrix_terms:
    degree/dimension - clarify which one means what
    



cheb_utils:
    match_size - i don't understand the assignment syntax

    get_var_list - missing parameters, etc
